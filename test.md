# Introduction

__OVIS__ is a modular system for HPC data collection, transport, storage, 
log message exploration, and visualization as well as analysis. OVIS 3.3.0 comes with
_LDMS_, _Baler_, and _SOS_ as a git submodule.

## Lightweight Distributed Metric Server (LDMS)

LDMS is a low-overhead, low-latency framework for collecting, transfering, and storing
metric data on a large distributed computer system.
The framework includes

* a public API with a reference implementation,
* tools for collecting, aggregating, transporting, and storing metric values,
* collectors for several common types of metrics.
* Data transport over socket, RDMA (IB/iWarp/RoCE), and Cray Gemini as well as Aries.

The API provides a way for vendors to expose system information in a uniform manner without
being required to provide source code for accessing the information (although we advise it be included)
which might reveal proprietary methods or information.

Metric information can be updated by a kernel module which runs only when
applications yield the processor and transported using RDMA-like operations, resulting in
minimal jitter during collection. LDMS has been run on 10,000 cores collecting
over 100,000 metric values per second with less than 0.2% overhead.

## Scalable Storage System (SOS)

SOS is a high-performance, indexed, object-oriented database designed to efficiently
manage structured data on persistent media. More information can be found at 
the SOS GitHub website <https://github.com/opengridcomputing/SOS>.

There is no need to clone the SOS project separatedly. It is advised to install SOS
from the git submodule under OVIS to ensure the compatility with OVIS v3.3.0.
See more info in the [Obtaining OVIS source code](#obtaining-ovis-source-code).

## Baler

Baler is an aggregation of log message exploration and analysis tools. _balerd_ is
the tool that tokenizes log messages using user-specified dictionaries.
The log messages are then groupped together according to their token sequences.
Each group is represented by a Baler pattern -- a token sequence.

Baler stores the log message patterns, the raw log messages, and other infomation in
its database. _bquery_ is a tool to query Baler database for the Baler patterns,
raw log messages, and message statistics by hosts and/or time.

Baler also comes with an association mining tool -- _bassoc_ -- that can be used
to discover sequence of occurrence patterns of log messages and to perform causal analysis.

# Obtaining OVIS source code

You may clone OVIS source (and its submodules) from the official [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ovis-hpc/ovis.git
cd ovis
# If you are interested in storing LDMS data in the SOS storage
# or you are interested in using Baler,
# please perform the last two steps.
git submodule init sos
git submodule update sos
```

# Dependencies

* autoconf (>=2.63), automake, libtool
* libreadline
* libevent2 (>=2.0.21)
	* For recent Ubuntu and CentOS 7, libevent2 can be installed from the central repo.
	* If you want to install from source, please find it here. <http://libevent.org/>
* For LDMS and Baler Python Interface:
	* Python-2.7. If you have python-2.6, you will need the _argparse_ module.
	* swig
* Some LDMS plug-ins have dependency on additional libraries. 
For cray-related LDMS sampler plug-in dependencies, please see the man page of the
plug-in in `ldms/man/`.


# Building OVIS

At the OVIS top directory,

```sh
	./autogen.sh
	mkdir <build directory>
	cd <build directory>
	../configure --prefix=<installed path> [options]
	make
	make install
```

To build _baler_ and _sos_, `--enable-baler` and `--enable-sos`, respectively,
must be given at the configure line.

# Supported hardware

* Ubuntu and friends
* CentOS and friends
* Cray XE6, Cray XK, Cray XC
